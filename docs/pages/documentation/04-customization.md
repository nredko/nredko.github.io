## Customization

When using portfolYOU as a theme means you can take advantage of the file overriding method. This allows you to overwrite any file in this theme with your own custom file, simply by matching the file name and path. The most common example of this would be if you want to add your own styles or change the favicon.  
To change the favicon for example just generate your own using [favicon](https://favicon.io/) or any other tool. Copy your new `favicon.ico` file into your own project with the same file path `assets/favicon.ico`.
