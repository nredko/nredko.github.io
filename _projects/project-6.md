# Grey-box

[Grey-Box](https://www.grey-box.ca/) provides wireless access to digital resources (such as environmental and geographical databases, as well as supporting content like Wikipedia and several MOOC-type online courses on related topics) in areas where access to the internet or to electricity is unreliable.

*I'm happy to collaborate with this non-profit initiative.*
