## Problem

The only tech problem was to support old Windows versions, starting from Windows 10 without any updates. It was solved by choosing quite old Dotnet 4.6

Installer was made with [NSIS](https://nsis.sourceforge.net)


Yet another problem was to find the time for it :)


## Result

Sources are closed. Sorry.


Binaries are available by these links:

[Installer](https://nredko.com/assets/DesktopCalendarSetup.zip)

[Portable version](https://nredko.com/assets/DesktopCalendarPortable.zip) - just extract it to local folder and run.


Please note, application and installer are not signed so you will get a warning from the windows system. You should click "Show more" then "Allow anyway".
