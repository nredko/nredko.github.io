# Authors

All authors of jewelery are students of [Art School for Children #4, Miass town](https://scholl4.ru/)

## Problem

The only problem was to support old Windows versions, starting from Windows 10 without any updates.

Installer was made with [NSIS](https://nsis.sourceforge.net)

## Result

Sources are closed. Sorry.


Binaries are available by these links:

[Installer](https://nredko.com/assets/DesktopCalendarSetup.zip)

[Portable version](https://nredko.com/assets/DesktopCalendarPortable.zip) - just extract it to local folder and run.


Please note, application and installer are not signed so you will get a warning from the windows system. You should click "Show more" then "Allow anyway".
